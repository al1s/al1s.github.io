==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

1. Practice vim and git(CLI via hub)
2. Prev: Format search form to make labels more aligned with input fields.
3. Prev: Work with styleguide.
4. Align the project's main page with the design layout via PixelPerfect.

==============================
  Done
==============================

4. Started from the footer of the project - don't know why. A lot of work, but I like the meditation it brings.
