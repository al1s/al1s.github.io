==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Make menu hide only on tablet and desktop versions or add input-label to hide JS-function.
#. Fix quirks in Safari: icons have become too small, everything become a mess on a wide screen.
#. Fix a masthead height on resolution wider 640px.
#. Fix an offer body text align for the gift message - now it aligns to center on resolutions less than 570.
#. Build additional pages - hotels, impression, blog.
#. Style the form on impression page.
#. Dive into JS.
#. Implement form validation.

  Done

7. Five hours dedicated to work through the 5th day of JS30 challenge. It wasn't hard, but a lot of time I spent trying to get data from Wikipedia. Failed - don't want to learn their API just to get through page parsing exercise. Everything else were about :code:`map`, :code:`reduce`, :code:`sort`, :code:`filter`.

   Obstacles:

   * can't make XHR to Wiki - they have policy that prohibits direct access.
   * can't read local file in browser - they all have restrictions to access to local data and it's right.
