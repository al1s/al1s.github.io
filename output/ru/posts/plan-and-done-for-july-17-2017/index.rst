  What will I learn today?

Dive into JS.

  Done
==============================

I've done the first part of algorithm challenges at freeCodeCamp. All code in one place is here - https://codepen.io/alstof/pen/VWNPbM.

Among other challenges there was one which I think will help me with hackerRank's Climbing the Leaderboard. It was about evaluating the place for any number in an arbitrary array. So I can easily apply the same approach to ranking elements of one array among the other.
