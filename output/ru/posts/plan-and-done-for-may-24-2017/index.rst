#. Build additional pages - hotels, impression, blog.

7. Going through FunFunFunction - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIkA60I0dKU - explanation of objects, this, bind in JS. Want to see visually when there are reference to an existing object or to a new object. Recalled that I've already seen something like this but for Python. It lives here - http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit, and it supports JS.
