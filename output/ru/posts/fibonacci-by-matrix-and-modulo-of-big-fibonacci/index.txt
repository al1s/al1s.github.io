How to get big fibonacci number using [matrices](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28548457/nth-fibonacci-number-for-n-as-big-as-1019)

How to calc [modulo](http://ideone.com/fP8krp) (similar approach, from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-fast-algorithm-to-find-the-remainder-of-the-division-of-a-huge-Fibonacci-number-by-some-big-integer) answer)

The trick behind these methods is __exponentiation by [squaring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRMVU3Gy_JY)__

Can be implemented as a recursion on binary multipliers or as binary map. Second one looks quite tricky at first, but I like it.
