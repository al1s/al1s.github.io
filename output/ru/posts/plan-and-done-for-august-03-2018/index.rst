==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Practicing Javascript at CodeFellow.

==============================
  Done
==============================

Today I learned:

* I liked to try TDD. Didn't have a lot of practice with it but it looks like a right way to write code. It requires a lot of work before you start coding a solution. It could work with personal projects, but it's the path to disaster in a production environment with a huge codebase and many other developers on board.  

* One more surprising observation about time planning: I thought it would take 30 minutes to code 6 little functions. In fact, 2 hours. I took into account only the time I needed to write the code, but repo work plus restrictions on available JS assets added a huge overhead.
