1. Great article - https://benfrain.com/learning-vim-front-end-coding-month/ - about web dev experimenting with making vim his working editor. His .vimrc on the github - https://gist.github.com/benfrain/f09dd39e66fe2da9cf0a.
2. Article - https://anyscreensize.com/blog/gulp-sass-browser-sync-front-end-dev/ - that needs some additional installation:
    `npm install --save-dev node-neat`
