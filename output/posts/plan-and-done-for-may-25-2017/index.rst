7. Started JS30 marathon - https://javascript30.com. First day - a drum machine: implement audio file play on keybord press using already set web-page. My idea: go through element's attributes and play those sound which :code:`keyCode` equal to key pressed.

   Have found helpfull following tips:

   * on key press event handling - https://stackoverflow.com/a/12578420.
   * on classes addition/removal - https://stackoverflow.com/a/196038.
   * multichannel audio support to prevent sound stuttering when a user press on many keys simultaneously - http://www.storiesinflight.com/html5/audio.html.

   Total time - two hours.
