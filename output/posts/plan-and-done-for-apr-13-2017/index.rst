==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

1. Pass JQuery tests [here](http://try.jquery.com/)
2. Study another 5 CSS things on tympanus.net
3. Fix flex orientation in the project for media-box with icons.
4. Add logo to head menu in the project.
5. Add SVG mask to the masthead in the project.
6. Fix map background in search-form__wrapper, now it has strange upper gutter.
7. Make masthead fluid.
8. Continue practicing vim.
9. Find a way how to work with local images and integrate them into the gulp workflow.

==============================
  Done
==============================

3. The main reason they are mess is css remix during build process. Yeah, that
was exact the reason. And now I've made it simpler and fixed it.

5. Done. Added as png-file. There was a strange quirk - first I haven't seen
images in browser at all and then I realized the root for path of images is the
css folder, so I should point images folder before.

6. Fixed. Don't know how.

8. For buffers check help - :help usr_07.txt, :help tabpage and :help buffers.
To store session layout: mkview [filename], to restore - lo [filename].
