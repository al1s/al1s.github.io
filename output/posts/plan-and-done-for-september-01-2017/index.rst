==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

1. I am moving towards application to Microsoft LEAP program - http://www.industryexplorers.com/applicants. What should I do to fit better? My deadline is 15 September 2017.

2. FreeCodeCamp project: Wikipedia viewer.

==============================
  Done
==============================

2. User Story:

* I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
* I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

Completed initial search functionality. Wikimedia engine contains tons of functionality. Looks intimidating at first. There is a need for less twisted documentation, something like a roadmap where you can get the overall view before diving into details.

My idea is to display data the user is searching for right on the page. If many pages are found, then give a user the same look as Wiki gives - many topics on one page. But the overall idea is to connect voice recognition engine with wiki search to get all power of current state of AI.
