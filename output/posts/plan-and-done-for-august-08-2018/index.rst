==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Practicing Javascript at CodeFellow.

==============================
  Done
==============================

Today I learned:

* refactoring takes much of time. And advantages aren't obvious in a short term. Anyway, I like how the code looks now.

* today I had a plan and I'm happy with the result, so I see quite clear: no plan - no pleasure from the finished work.

* I tend to build engines, independent components before starting working with actual tasks. I see it this way: if I have all the pieces for a domain modeling it's easy then to organize them into a finished product. Just make the task solution as far declarative as it could be. It has drawbacks.
