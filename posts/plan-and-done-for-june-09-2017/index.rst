==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

1. Dive into JS.

==============================
  Done
==============================

1. What is this all about - http://al1s.github.io/posts/plan-and-done-for-may-25-2017/.

   Day 12 - Draw unicorns all around the page on KONAMI code key sequence. Here is about KONAMI code - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code. And here is cornifier - https://github.com/Cornify/Cornify/blob/master/js/cornify.js.

   User story:

   * As a user, I want to press key sequence (KONAMI), so that I'll get a unicorn or a rainbow on the page.
   * As a user, I want to press than any key, so that I'll get more unicorns and rainbows on the page, one per each key pressed.

   Done. It was the simplest one among JS30. Here is a little about keypress event and the right property to get key code - https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/javascript-keycodes/.
