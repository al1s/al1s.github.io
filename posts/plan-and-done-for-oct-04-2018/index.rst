Mindset to be a successful engineer 
_______________________________________________________________________________

There is a bunch of articles and a requirement to write 3-4 sentences about each of them.

=====================================================================================================================================================
`Upgrade Your Tech Skills with Deliberate Practice <https://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice>`_
=====================================================================================================================================================
The article emphasizes the need of practice outside a comfort zone and cites requirements of effective and successful practice. While I'm agreed in general, there is one of it which alarms me: the practice should be hard. For me - it should be rather challenging, inspiring you to find the solution, rather than being hard. Hard things could easily kill productivity and end up considered as hardly achievable. It's all about the balance between existing knowledge and those required to solve the problem.

===============================================================================================================================================
`Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset <https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en>`_
===============================================================================================================================================
The speech for TED presents the slightly different view to the problem of practicing and finding solution to problems. It discusses the need for setting educational efforts and attention not on achieving the result now, but on the process of finding solution. From my prospective it's definitely important to emphasize the progress, but it doesn't address the real question - how to motivate, how to set the focus on ongoing process of finding a solution instead of stuck-and-give up strategy on one hand or on the other where a result is not the goal, but the process.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
`Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit <https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance#t-5024>`_
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
This talk was interesting in a way, that it defines the grit as a base to build steady path of development. But in no words it addresses the way to achieve, to develop the grit trait. It interfere with the previous talk where we're presented with the idea of equality as a measure of successfully acquired process thinking strategy on the way to achieving results. We have a grit as a criteria of highly achievers but we don't know exactly how to raise them.

==============================================================================================================================================================================
`Alain de Botton on Redefining Success <https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success>`_
==============================================================================================================================================================================
Success as a measure not only of personal efforts but as an indicator of lots of other people's lives and as a sum of different events, with a dash of chance is the topic of the speech. It's quite natural for me to take life as some kind of adventure. Plus Russian traditions (family, literature) and my parents' engineering approach define success in a way which is different from American. Self-exploration, discovery, and application of your passion for real life, to other people's lives, makes the person successful.

`The Drs. Sarah on Impostor Syndrome - Pt 2 <https://soundcloud.com/drssarahcare/self-care-with-drs-sarah-impostor-syndrome-part-ii>`_
=============================================================================================================================================
A discussion on different encounters of imposter syndrome. I'm glad they mentioned the need for balance between being humble and self-confident. I haven't got the balance yet, so I was glad to hear their suggestions: meditate, breathe, affirmation (I'm positive, I'll get the position; I'll make the presentation); write - free writing.
