What did we do well, that if we don’t discuss we might forget?
==============================
It was a pleasure to work with Jeff - he grasps different concepts and ideas very fast and always ready for more adventures.

==============================
What did we learn?
==============================
Practiced promises, mentoring.

==============================
What should we do differently next time?
==============================
Work together on a bigger project?

==============================
What still puzzles us, or what do we need to learn more about?
==============================
