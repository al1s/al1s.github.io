C#
__

I've started practicing basic C# fluency by taking small assessments on CodeWars. The first logistical question I've got - how to setup a test env for C# projects? My steps (based on many sources but primarily on `MS dotnet Core guide <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test>`_) include:

Packages to install (with :code:`dotnet add package PackageName`):
* NUnit;
* NUnit.Console;
* NUnit.ConsoleRunner;
* NUnit.Runners;

Folders/files setup:
* start a project: :code:`dotnet new console -o "MyAppName"`;
* initialize a solution :code:`cd MyAppName; dotnet new sln`;
* initialize a main project :code:`mkdir ProjectName; cd ProjectName; dotnet new classLib`;
* add the main project to the solution :code:`cd ..; dotnet sln add ./ProjectName/ProjectName.csproj`;
* initialize a test project :code:`mkdir ProjectName.Tests; cd ProjectName.Tests; dotnet new nunit`;
* add reference to the main project :code:`dotnet add reference ../ProjectName/ProjectName.csproj`;
* add the test project to the solution :code:`cd ..; dotnet sln add ./ProjectName.Tests/ProjectName.Tests.csproj`;
