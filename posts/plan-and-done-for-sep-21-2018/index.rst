Retro about getting data by Express server from external API (Google Books)
____________________________________________________

==============================
What did we do well, that if we donâ€™t discuss we might forget?
==============================
Practiced in debugging Express <=> Postgres interaction;

==============================
What did we learn?
==============================
Craft your database schema carefully not to be bitten by poor design later: we created the table with the unique constraint on author column and today were debugging insertion error for 20 minutes before found the reason why we can't add another book.

==============================
What should we do differently next time?
==============================
Spend more time on styling.

==============================
What still puzzles us, or what do we need to learn more about?
==============================
Best practices for creating a robust server with Node/Express/DB with input validation and unified error handling. Current state looks fragile.
