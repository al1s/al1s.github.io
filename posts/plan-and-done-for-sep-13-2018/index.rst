Retro about attaching Postgresql to our blog engine
____________________________________________________

==============================
What did we do well, that if we donâ€™t discuss we might forget?
==============================
We talked a lot. We switched not so often. Databases in conjunction with web-servers are hard to grasp in a short period of time, so my team definitely needed some additional visual explanations. 

==============================
What did we learn?
==============================
Practiced to explain things in digestible parts visualizing flows between Browser-WebServer-DB.

==============================
What should we do differently next time?
==============================
Switch more often.

==============================
What still puzzles us, or what do we need to learn more about?
==============================
My team struggles with all the flows and vocabulary about requests/responses/POST/GET.
