==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

1. Practicing vim and git(CLI via hub)
2. Study another 5 CSS things on tympanus.net
3. Continue practicing vim and git.
4. Make JQuery work in the project.
5. Make SASS work through gulp.

==============================
 Done
==============================
1. Want a new repo on github?

   .. code-block:: bash

     hub init [NAME]
     cd [NAME]
     hub create [NAME]

Now you've got [NAME] repo in your github.

2. all - to set all rules either to inherit or initial.

3.1. Want to rename git? - look http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2041993/how-to-rename-a-git-repository.

3.2. Vim:

* The great way to work with a project using many files is to utilize power of ``ag`` instead of bult-in ``grep``. The receipt - https://robots.thoughtbot.com/faster-grepping-in-vim. Binded ``K`` to search for word under cursor. And there are - http://vimawesome.com/plugin/ag-vim-back-to-december - shortcuts inside quickfix window.

* In order to run macvim from CLI in Mac OS copy shell script - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4winckler/macvim/master/src/MacVim/mvim - to /usr/local/bin and chmod 744 on it. The receipt from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2056219.

5. Decided to try repeat the project using as the base workflow and blocks from Gromov's NTH-starter-kit project. The main question is whether to use his blocks or main.
