==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Make menu hide only on tablet and desktop versions or add input-label to hide JS-function.
#. Fix quirks in Safari: icons have became too small, everything become a mess on a wide screen.
#. Fix a masthead height on resolution wider 640px.
#. Fix an offer body text align for the gift message - now it aligns to center on resolutions less than 570.
#. Build additional pages - hotels, impression, blog.
#. Style the form on impression page.

  Done

**Spontaneous.** Some about closures in JS - http://stackoverflow.com/a/111111.

6. Still building JS animation for the spin element on review/impression page. Found a funny thing about changing value of input element manually and by buttons - after manual change no buttons work using ``setAttribute`` method. Solved using ``elm.value`` for assigning an exact value. An explanation is here - http://stackoverflow.com/a/29929977.
