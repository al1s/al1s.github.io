==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Practicing Javascript at CodeFellow.

==============================
  Done
==============================

`Result <https://github.com/trecain/chocolate-pizza>`_ of the day.

Today I learned:

* I can make a layout for an easy landing page without JS in 3 hours. It's a progress, but such CSS sprints still make me exhausted.
* Rules approved by team members are the most important thing in a teamwork or you risk spend another hour/day/week trying to unify the code base.
* I don't like solving codeÂ problems in mind when it's more about untangling code, than about grasping some algorithm meaning or a business rule.
