==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Practicing Javascript at CodeFellow.

==============================
  Done
==============================

Today I learned:

* I definitely can write code using the small range of basic commands.
* My goal now is to write it in a way when it stays expressive and digestible for future me.
* I like playing with CSS, it's meditative but very time-consuming.
