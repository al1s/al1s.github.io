  Done

1. What is this all about - http://al1s.github.io/posts/plan-and-done-for-may-25-2017/.

   Day 16 - a paralax effect with text shadow. A user story:

   * As a user I want to move a mouse around on a page and see how one of the element's shadow reflect mouse movements, so that the page seems animated and react to my mouse movements;

   Ideas:

   * if an element in a visible part of the screen - handle the mouse movements;
   * the closer the mouse cursor to the element - the shorter the shadow;
   * calculate the mouse position relativly to element center, calculate the distance;
