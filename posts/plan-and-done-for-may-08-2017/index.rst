#. Make menu hide only on tablet and desktop versions or add input-label to hide JS-function.
#. Dismissed: Format search form to make labels more aligned with input fields.

#. Fix a masthead height on resolution wider 640px.
#. Fix an offer body text align for the gift message - now it aligns to center on resolutions less than 570.
#. Unify color use - I have variables for it.
