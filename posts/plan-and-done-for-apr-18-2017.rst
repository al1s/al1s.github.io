==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

1. Practice vim and git(CLI via hub)
2. Resolve JQuery datepick plugin error.
3. Prev: Format search form to make labels more aligned with input fields.
4. Prev: Work with styleguide.

==============================
  Done
==============================

1. Powerful practical advices on using Vim - https://medium.com/@schtoeffel/you-don-t-need-more-than-one-cursor-in-vim-2c44117d51db.

2. Stuck. Everything looks like on original page - http://keith-wood.name/datepick.html, but it doesn't work.

   Found JQuery debugger browser plugin which shows event handlers binded to html (DOM) elements right in Chrome DevTools.
