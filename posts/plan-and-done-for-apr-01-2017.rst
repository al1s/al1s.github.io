==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. I want to practice web projects layout with HTML and CSS.

==============================
  Done
==============================

Found the Sedona project - https://github.com/brotherilia/sedona. Looks great for my purpose - a lot of different elements, a fluid design requirements, forms, Google map API.

My approach:

* Sources - https://github.com/al1s/sedona
* Result - https://al1s.github.io/sedona/
