#. Make menu hide only on tablet and desktop versions or add input-label to hide JS-function.
#. Fix quirks in Safari: icons have became too small, everything become a mess on a wide screen.
#. Fix a masthead height on resolution wider 640px.
#. Fix an offer body text align for the gift message - now it aligns to center on resolutions less than 570.
#. Build additional pages - hotels, impression, blog.
#. Style the form on impression page.

  Done

And another thing - how to change guest number inside one of the form input.
