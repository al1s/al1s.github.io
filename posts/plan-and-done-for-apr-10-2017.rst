==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

1. How to tune ``input`` in css.
2. How to combine form with inputs in Sedona project.
3. How to handle vim and git during all this activities.
4. Go through - http://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/

==============================
  Done
==============================

3. What I need to start a new project.

   * Run in a project folder::

      npm install gulp gulp-util gulp-sass gulp-uglify gulp-rename gulp-minify-css gulp-gh-pages gulp-notify gulp-concat gulp-plumber gulp-postcss css-mqpacker autoprefixer node-neat browser-sync --save-dev

   * Copy gulpfile.js from previous src. (many different sources e.g. https://gist.github.com/DESIGNfromWITHIN/11383339 or https://github.com/nicothin/epic_start-kit/blob/master/gulpfile.jskk)
   * Create directory srtucture::

      mkdir scss
      mkdir js
      mkdir sass
      mkdir css
      mkdir stylesheets

4. Went through::

    background-clip - border-box, padding-box, content-box
    all
    initial - reset to default value and it's not a UA values;
    inherit - use it to inherit values from parent to child. Doesn't work for shorthands.
    unset - it's inherit or initial depending on wether the value is inheritable or not for the element.

2. Done. With additional container. So I have wrapper to carry the map background and container, which holds the for in fit.

1. Done. Easy as any other element.
