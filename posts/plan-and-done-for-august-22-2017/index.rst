==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

I am moving towards application to Microsoft LEAP program - http://www.industryexplorers.com/applicants. What should I do to fit better? My deadline is 15 September 2017.

My resume in md: https://gist.github.com/al1s/d5a3b2fe02eaa4a75e3ab2ed3d2073a8

There are two essay topics in an application form:

Why are you interested in programming? (specify whether you're interested in Dev or PM track)
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
I'm interested in the Dev track.

About twenty years ago I self-studied Intel assembly language. I wrote simple utilities: a tiny module that did not let the computer slip into a screensaver. And there were many patches to game executables to get immortality or unlimited ammo. It was MS-DOS epoch.

At University I worked in my faculty computer lab as a system administrator and database developer. I took a part in the implementation of the app for monitoring student academic performance. That was the time of Windows 95 and MS Access.

Last 10 years I worked with large scale databases. We processed 2 million financial transactions per day. And there were almost 500 million in an online data warehouse. It was the time of great challenges and accomplishments.  I achieved recognition as an application developer, a team-lead, and a solution architect. There I've got experience with MS SQL Server and its analytical, reporting and integration services.

About a year ago I moved from Russia to the USA I set the new goals. And one of it is to deliver value as a professional web developer. I'm stubborn in pursuing my goals so I dedicate all my spare time during the last six months to a self-studying. My accomplishments are in the next section.

Einstein once said, that if the Universe is a friendly place then we would use our technology to create tools and models for understanding this Universe. That's what motivates me - the pure curiosity about the world, about people, and tools. Ultimately all the tools we end up creating are just a way for self-exploring and self-awareness.

My recent progress and perseverance will bring their fruits. Microsoft LEAP program could become a huge leverage towards the chosen goal for me.


What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far? (specify whether you're interested in Dev or PM track)
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The first web development experience I've got in 2000. I've built a personal page to satisfy the curiosity about the technologies available and share my notes with friends and family. Then there was nothing of modern stuff like ES5, HTML5, CSS3 available.

Done in the last six months: brushed up HTML skills, studied CSS, practiced Javascript.

I've started my current journey into web development with building replicas. My models were interesting demos of different kinds of page layout. The first was https://al1s.github.io/Futurismo/ where I've practiced CSS flexbox and horizontal spacing in web typography. The next was https://al1s.github.io/Jazz/ where I practiced CSS Flexbox. The model layout was built using CSS Grid, so I was curious how it to achieve the same appearance with older tools.

I spent almost half of a month moving through 30 days javascript challenge (one day, one app). It was challenging and I wrote multiple blog posts about my progress, challenges, and the ways to overcome them. Working demos are collected here - https://al1s.github.io/JavaScript30/. I haven't finished it yet for the reason to concentrate more on solving algorithms' tasks and to lean on a crisper curriculum.

The next step was a fictitious landing page. The goal was to implement it from design layout keeping all sizes perfectly matched to the original. I've practiced BEM CSS methodology, responsive, mobile-first approach. The page was built using Gulp automation and SASS CSS processor.

Along with projects I've already mentioned I'm following Free Code Camp curriculum. I've built WeatherNow app - a local weather informer (https://al1s.github.io/WeatherNow/). My notes made during the implementation I compiled in an article. I published it (https://goo.gl/4DDKes) to share my thoughts about the design process and chosen building tools. Another app is an AskWiki (https://al1s.github.io/AskWiki/). It's a facade to the Wikipedia search engine. Here I practiced working with VS Code as IDE (because Atom glitches finally started to irk and Vim or browser's dev tools are too spartan as JS IDE).
