The goal of\n\t\t\t\tbehavioral therapy is to give you tools to understand and fix the\n\t\t\t\timmediate cause of unwanted feelings and behaviors.

Over time, this discomfort becomes a pattern that grows on\n\t\t\t\titself. A situation that some people might find joyful causes you to\n\t\t\t\tfeel sad or afraid. Cognitive behavioral therapy argues those feelings\n\t\t\t\tare based on a repeated distortion in your thoughts. Doing a thought\n\t\t\t\trecord, or thought diary, can help you break down the thoughts that\n\t\t\t\tcause the emotions, and develop a healthier, more balanced relationship\n\t\t\t\tto the situation.\n\t\t\t</Text>\n\t\t\t<Text>\n\t\t\t\tA thought record turns you into a detective for your brain. We all have\n\t\t\t\tsituations that we think about and suffer over, but it can be hard to\n\t\t\t\tsystematically process what we were thinking when we started feeling\n\t\t\t\tbad. Thought records allow us to critically look at these situations and\n\t\t\t\tattempt to be a dispassionate observer of our own thoughts and the\n\t\t\t\tfeelings they cause.
