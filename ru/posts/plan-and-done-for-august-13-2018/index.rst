==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Practicing Javascript, git and workflow at CodeFellow.

==============================
  Done
==============================

`Result <https://github.com/al1s/busMall/pull/1>`_ of the day.

* I need more practice in building an architecture of an app. Now it's hard to decide - which way to choose to implement requirements. I hope I will eventually find time to dive deeper into design patterns.

* Built a `little helper <https://gist.github.com/al1s/ef70628b0af97888f5b210a2aceb22d7>`_ to have a picture of what's going on with my assignments in Canvas - I don't want to lose points just because for two days I thought I already submitted everything. The helper works only in the devÂ console in the tab where Canvas already open.
