Retro about final project for Code 301
_______________________________________________________________________________

==============================
What did we learn?
==============================
Hard to pull together everything - server routes, functions, DB queries, ejs parts. I felt a need for some best practice routines to handle it.

Keep consistency while working with data on the server-side. Drawing DB schema and data lifecycle inside your app help a lot. 

CSS - styling modules, positioning. Weirdness with Unicode - on mobile heart symbol is converted to emoji and becomes red no matter the actual font color set by CSS.

Add to favorites was a challenging adventure cause it requires to design how data should flow between different views in a consistent way.

==============================================================
What still puzzles us, or what do we need to learn more about?
==============================================================
Building REST API - implementing all routes and methods for the full-fledged project
