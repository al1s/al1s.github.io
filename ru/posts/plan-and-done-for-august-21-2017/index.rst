==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

I am moving towards application to Microsoft LEAP program - http://www.industryexplorers.com/applicants. What should I do to fit better? My deadline is 15 September 2017.

==============================
  Done
==============================

My tagline is "Let's look how far stubbornness and curiosity would take me". In order to prepare as best as possible I follow the plan:

* rewrite my resume so it clearly shows my web-development skill;
* syncronize my Linkedin profile with resume;
* write an article dedicated to web development;
* build a portfolio page;

I'm done with the first and just finished the draft of the third. Here is tools I used to write it:

* an analyzer to make your headline good - https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer;
* an analyzer to calculate readability level of the text - http://www.hemingwayapp.com/;
* a Flickr license retriever - http://www.imagecodr.org/;
* an article with useful advice - https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-get-published-in-the-freecodecamp-medium-publication-9b342a22400e;
