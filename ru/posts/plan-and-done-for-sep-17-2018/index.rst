Retro about attaching Postgresql to our blog engine (JOIN queries and promises)
____________________________________________________

==============================
What did we do well, that if we donâ€™t discuss we might forget?
==============================
Accomplished everything that was possible (except select-option tags) with just CSS. Sprites are still a pain.

==============================
What did we learn?
==============================
Practice CSS and form styling. Learned basic input validation using CSS.

==============================
What should we do differently next time?
==============================
Plan first! Then work according to the plan step by step.

==============================
What still puzzles us, or what do we need to learn more about?
==============================
As I've got we can't style :code:`option` tag. Adding javascript just to deal with the element's style seems unreasonable.
