==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Practicing Javascript, git and workflow at CodeFellow.

==============================
  Done
==============================

Discipline and order rule! I messed with the order of PRs and destination branches for PRs on Github and spent half an hour trying to untangle all this.

I'm grateful to the lab practice that we have so much practice with git.
