==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Practicing Javascript at CodeFellow.

==============================
  Done
==============================

Today I learned:

* I enjoyed our Pair programming session. I did it before on my previous job, so it was interesting to dive into it again but with only English available as a mean of communication.

* To be a driver takes a lot of energy not to switch roles with a navigator and vice versa. It's always easier to grab the key and start typing, then to stop and think. 

* The hardest part is to explain my thoughts in a simple and digestible form. The easiest part is to be a driver - push buttons, check for correct syntax.

* As a navigator, I planned and utilized all two hours to improve my code in the way I like.
* As a driver, it took 30 minutes.
