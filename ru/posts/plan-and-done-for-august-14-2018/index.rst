==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

#. Practicing Javascript, git and workflow at CodeFellow.

==============================
  Done
==============================

`Result <https://github.com/al1s/busMall/pull/2>`_ of the day.

Started the dive into extensions. Built small one to show current assingnmets in Canvas LMS when I'm on the site - such approach doesn't require any additionsl authentication. Right now it prints the result to console. Next step - put the results to either the page or a new tab.

Chart.js is good in terms of basic tasks. Lack of documentation, lack of freedom, lack of challenges but a result is on the table after an hour.

Our labs are great exercises to grasp the importance of planning and prioritizing of tasks.
