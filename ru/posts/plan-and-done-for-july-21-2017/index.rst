==============================
  What will I learn today?
==============================

Dive into JS.

==============================
  Done
==============================

Digged into project of a quotation machine from FreeCodeCamp (here - https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine). The results are:

* as a Codepen playground - https://codepen.io/alstof/pen/qjzzMb;
* as a single page -

Learned/recalled:

* don't use function call in callback - just function name needed, so no parenthesis - :code:`function(params, callback())` vs :code:`function(params, callback)`, here is SO - https://stackoverflow.com/a/21616421;
* dinamically regenerate twitter button to get desired tweet text inside a twitter web intent (what is web intent described in the article about twitter button - https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button)- https://twittercommunity.com/t/how-to-replace-data-text-content-with-javascript-variable/19404/4;
* practiced :code:`fetch`, encountered CORS obstacles - quote API and Codepen don't allow cross origin js, solved it with proxy - https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/;
* found a couple of this quote API - first is Forismatic - https://forismatic.com/en/api/ and second is WikiQuote - https://github.com/natetyler/wikiquotes-api.
