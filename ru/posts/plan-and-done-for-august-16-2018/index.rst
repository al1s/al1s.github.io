`Result <https://github.com/rh24/seattle-201d43-lab-14/>`_ of the day.

It was a very lazy morning and very intensive afternoon.Â 

All transformation stuff adds a little if you don't dig into interesting effects, something like a story unfolding in front of you. Or some esthetically pleasable design effects, which make navigation (read UX) easier. Everything that is beyond these is usually annoying and distractive.

Pair programming was hard - primarily because we didn't agree before about data structures to use to transfer data between moving part of an app. It's a good lesson for me.
