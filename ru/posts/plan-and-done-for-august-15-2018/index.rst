`Result <https://github.com/al1s/busMall/pull/3>`_ of the day.

The challenge was to rebuild objects based on previously saved JSON. I didn't want to modify the constructor, so first I tried to implement an object builder. My object has a function call to initialize one parameter using other. And this call didn't work - parameter undefined. Dropped the idea of a builder and returned to object assigning. And finally, it worked.

Another challenge - how to draw two charts on the page. I tried to add a new chart to existing wrapper - unsuccessfully, tried to put it in a separate wrapper - no. Just dropped the idea.
