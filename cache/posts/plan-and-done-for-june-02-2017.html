<li><p class="first">The next JS30 assignment is to build a free drawing tool using HTML5 canvas element. The plan is to implement:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>draw circle function with two supporting functions: the first should get a mouse position and the second should get a mouse velocity. The first I need to draw circle in a place where mouse is located in a moment and the second - to manage line width: the faster the mouse is moved - the thinner line is drawn;</li>
<li>spline interpolation - to make the line drawn looks more natural. Without it I have only dots with intervals which depend on a mouse velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a manual on canvas drawing - <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage</a>. An example on mouse movement tracking - <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7790764">https://stackoverflow.com/a/7790764</a>. It's a bit weird - uses both event driven and interval scanning, but I didn't get how the last works.

<p>Got stuck a little - spline code do the job, but I don't want so complex logic, I want to try to implement the drawing canvas only with cubic bezier curve, so I want to calculate control point position. I know coordinates of two other points, I can find the distance between them, I can set the distance from to the desired control point voluntary and calculate its coordinates accordingly.
