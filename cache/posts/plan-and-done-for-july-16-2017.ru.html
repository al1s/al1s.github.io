<p>I'm stuck with both challenges on HR - roads and ladder failed performance test and roads failed functional tests. It's very exhaustive to run through the code again and again without success especially in time shortage conditions. Switched to another coding activity - returned to freeCodeCamp curriculum to practice easy steps, to make them smoother. After it I'll plan to be back and crack these nuts.</p>
<p>I've practiced:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the easiest way to compare arrays is to <code>JSON.stringify</code> them, but it's bad for performamce. Better way described here - <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14853974">https://stackoverflow.com/a/14853974</a>.</li>
<li>the way to put variable inside regExp is to initialize it as a regExp object <code>new RegExp('someText' + variable)</code> - <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4029123">https://stackoverflow.com/a/4029123</a>.</li>
</ul>
