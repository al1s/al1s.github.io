<li>Start your Gulp journey here <a class="reference external" href="https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/">https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/</a>. It will make all things clear from the beginning: what is package.json, gulpfile.js. And there is a bunch <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/master/docs/recipes">https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/master/docs/recipes</a> of receipts. I'm still curious about sass, because right now I don't use it at all. And I don't concat files.</li>
<li>Just put code into js folder and start working. Right now my gulpfile.js concatenate all js sources into one. And it doesn't have any lint inside. To add! And by the way - how to build things in order? Right now the solutions are: put files into gulp in a right order - <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/21961217">http://stackoverflow.com/a/21961217</a> - by pointing specifically one by one in the gulp.src(...) and second is to use browserify - <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook">https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook</a> or webpack - <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/tree/blendid">https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/tree/blendid</a>.

<li><p class="first">CSS rules and pseudo-elements:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
outline - no width unlike border, but scarce functionality and browser support for it.
:link - for anchors with href.
:visited - switched back to link state after a while.
:focus - cursor with tab or mousedown on the link or input element to trigger
:hover - mouse hover.
:active - when user clicked the element. Main use - to give UI feedback: something happening, we didn't freeze.
