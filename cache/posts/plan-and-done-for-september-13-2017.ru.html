<p>After I finished MVP my next step was to enhance UI, to make it more interactive and appealing. My plan was to try at least two things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a tags cloud as a background around a search bar. I wanted to get the main page of Wikipedia and parse it to weighted tags. All these tags would be fed into cloud generator and it returns a cloud of terms with links to Wiki. Here is a cloud generator - <a class="reference external" href="https://timdream.org/wordcloud2.js/">https://timdream.org/wordcloud2.js/</a>. The idea is great but requires time to dive into. I want something less time consuming.</li>
<li>search bar should be placed in the center of a screen and on user input smoothly float to top, freeing a room for search results.</li>
</ul>
