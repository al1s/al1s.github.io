<li>Masthead is ready. Added intermediate width breakpoints.</li>

<li>Done. It was a flexbox with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flex-basis:</span> auto</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flex-grow:</span> 1</tt>, so the width of each of three containers wasn't evenly distibuted. Changed <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flex-grow</span></tt> to 0 and add <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">min-width:</span> 30%</tt>.</li>
