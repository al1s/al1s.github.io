</li>
<li><p class="first">Done. The reason of datepick didn't work was unnecessary class usage - <cite>is-datepick</cite>. This class is internal for plugin and connects to an element by JS. I included it manually, because it shows in example page for plugin. I shouldn't.</p>
<p>To find it I fired up blank project (it's easy with boilerplates like NTH or something from - ) setup minimal configuration with only plugin scripts and basic html. Then I started to play with different versions of html and finally found unnecessary class.</p>
