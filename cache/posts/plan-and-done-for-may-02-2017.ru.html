<li><p class="first">While fitting layout to tablet version found many funny decisions made in the beginning of the project. They all aligned to mobile version pretty well but ablolutely rigid for adapting the main page to another media-width. For example, my <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.media-body</span></tt> class was a flexbox and three elements inside of it were <tt class="docutils literal">column</tt> directioned. But it's absolutely counterintuitive to align them to a specific vertical rhythm. I have to remove <tt class="docutils literal">flexbox</tt> attribute from the wrapper to have a chance to adjust inner elements with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">margin-top</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Done. But now I have to go back to mobile and fix all stuff which now became broken.</p>
