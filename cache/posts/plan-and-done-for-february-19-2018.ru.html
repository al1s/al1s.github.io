<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>How to implement game engine - what is the algorithm inside it?</li>
<li>What is a winning in terms of algorithmical calculation - how to calculate that I have winning condition on the board?</li>
<li>How to find which player's turn next?</li>
<li>What is 'empty' value in an Array generated by <code>new Array(number)</code>?</li>
<li>After implementation of minimax I've found myself with an utility value but without moves - how could I add to minimax return any sugestions on the next move?</li>
<li>How to pass a parameter to an event callback function?</li>
<li>How to make the engine work in async with UI and prevent itching in a player interaction with the game?</li>
<li>How to restart the game after we've got either winning or draw conditions?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Solutions</h3>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Algo - minimax as it described in the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minimax&amp;section=8#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves">Wiki page</a>. Another explanations are at Youtube - <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik">academic</a>, less <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ELUvkSkCts">formal</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">SO gives the algorithm to estimate an <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1056352/2255031">answer</a>. I have alternative approach - find masks which represent winning, transform board into binary representation and apply mask to it. If result is the same as mask applied - here's winning position. The question: what is efficiency for each approach? For SO algo the complexity is O(n), n - is dimension of the board. For my approach - O(n^2 + n).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I can track the current player or just get it from the board state. I'll use reduce for it:
<code>array.reduce((res,elm) =&gt; elm ? res + 1 : res,0)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Unbelievably long search why my <code>toString</code> didn't work the right way - it just silently swallowed empty values. Here is a good snippet to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sitepoint.com/testing-for-empty-values/">detect</a> empty values in Array.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I shouldn't - I've implemented the separate chooseMove() function where I initialize all available moves with their utility values and than I just choose the best or any depending whether utility equal for multiple values or not.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">We can either bind <cite>this</cite> with additional paramenter to the function - take a look <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/28331157">here</a>. I've tried to use an arrow function as a callback, but it prevents me from removing listener down the road. Final approach is to make cells distinguishable by <code>id</code> and communicate through the DOM:</p>

</pre></li>
<li><p class="first">The broad <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Performance/Scenarios/Intensive_JavaScript">article</a> states that there are two available options: split intensive function into pieces and run every along with browser animation frames routine or use WebWorkers. As the <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">MDN article</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should try the approach, but later, when all bugs will be fixed and the game will be ready.
And I've found another option - <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API">Web Animation API</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I've implemented it as reinitialization of the whole application - the same routine which is called once an app starts. But here I've encountered another problem - multiple event handler calls and it escalates with each actual trigger. Looks like I add more and more identical handlers with each restart.</p>
<p>I've solved it by light reengineering the code: I don't need to reinitialize the whole app on reset, just draw the clear board and add all event listeners;</p>
