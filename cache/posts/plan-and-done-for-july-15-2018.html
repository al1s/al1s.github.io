<li><p class="first">There are too much data I want to retrieve from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/cbp-nonemp-zbp/cbp-api.html">Census bureau API</a> - it's ok to get 200 rows, but if I want to break it down to more grained data - the API shuts down. The reason I want more data - its current aggregation seems weird for my goals. For example - two industries (5415 - Computer Systems Design and Related Services is not in 51 - Information) belonging in my opinion to one group are actually in different.</p>
<p>One way to solve it - prefetch all data to local storage and work with it. Then what is the best way to do it? Or maybe it's better to pretend that I have one, and just work with data as if I have the API for it.</p>
