<p>Today I learned:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>refactoring takes much of time. And advantages aren't obvious in a short term. Anyway, I like how the code looks now.</li>
<li>today I had a plan and I'm happy with the result, so I see quite clear: no plan - no pleasure from the finished work.</li>
<li>I tend to build engines, independent components before starting working with actual tasks. I see it this way: if I have all the pieces for a domain modeling it's easy then to organize them into a finished product. Just make the task solution as far declarative as it could be. It has drawbacks.</li>
</ul>
