<h1>Done</h1>
<ol class="arabic" start="7">
<li><p class="first">Five hours dedicated to work through the 5th day of JS30 challenge. It wasn't hard, but a lot of time I spent trying to get data from Wikipedia. Failed - don't want to learn their API just to get through page parsing exercise. Everything else were about <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>filter</code>.</p>
<p>Obstacles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>can't make XHR to Wiki - they have policy that prohibits direct access.</li>
<li>can't read local file in browser - they all have restrictions to access to local data and it's right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
