<p>My thoughts about the final project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>first idea was to built a calendar with all required assignments from Canvas which are not finished yet sorted by submission date. But, first, it uses external API and it's forbidden, and second Canvas has tangled API which I don't want to dive in.</li>
<li>second thought - to build HTML to ASCII converter. Just for fun. It will require two steps: convert HTML into JPG, convert JPG into ASCII. I've found a <a class="reference external" href="http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/">solution</a> for the first task in a form of an external library. And here <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20435/Using-C-To-Generate-ASCII-Art-From-An-Image&gt;`_</span></a> is an explanation of converting pictures into ASCII art with a C# example. The idea is exciting but totally useless.</li>
<li>technical skills are easy to acquire through practice. My concerns now primarily about an organization - I easily dive into assignments and lose focus to details.</li>
<li>today's assignment was very good for practicing CSS - exactly what I needed, spend 4 hours just to style the page.</li>
</ul>
