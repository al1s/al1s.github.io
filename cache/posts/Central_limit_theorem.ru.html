<p>In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that, given certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables, each with a well-defined expected value and well-defined variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution.[wiki](<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem</a>)</p>
