<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>I am moving towards application to Microsoft LEAP program - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.industryexplorers.com/applicants">http://www.industryexplorers.com/applicants</a>. What should I do to fit better? My deadline is 15 September 2017.</li>

<li>User Story:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.</li>
<li>I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Completed initial search functionality. Wikimedia engine contains tons of functionality. Looks intimidating at first. There is a need for less twisted documentation, something like a roadmap where you can get the overall view before diving into details.</p>
<p>My idea is to display data the user is searching for right on the page. If many pages are found, then give a user the same look as Wiki gives - many topics on one page. But the overall idea is to connect voice recognition engine with wiki search to get all power of current state of AI.</p>
