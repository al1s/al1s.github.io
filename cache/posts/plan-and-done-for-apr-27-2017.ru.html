<li><p class="first">Blurry edges in the background shape. The reason - <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">background-size:</span> cover;</tt> so it makes the shape scaling.</p>
<p>Done! The picture finally matched with original by scaling explicitly with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">background-size</span></tt> and then setting exact <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">background-position</span></tt>. It started scaling enormously on screens larger than 320px, but I gonna fix it with media-queries.</p>
<p>Another challenge was scaling of italic text SVG in masthead. The reason was the use of relative height bigger then needed for elements being aligned - I use it more as positioning tool, but it's totally unnatural for a height to be a positioning tool of the element. Fixed it with the use of correct (smaller) height and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">margin-top</span></tt>.</p>

<li><p class="first">Basic Google map tutorial - <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/google_maps_basic.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/google_maps_basic.asp</a> - provides with all needed functionality. In addition to the JS code I need coordinates of the place I wanna show on the map and Google API key to work with map engine with my own credentials. In order to get coordinates (taken from - <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lifewire.com/latitude-longitude-coordinates-google-maps-1683398">https://www.lifewire.com/latitude-longitude-coordinates-google-maps-1683398</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Open Google maps, locate the place.</li>
<li>Right-click (Control-click on a Mac) the location.</li>
<li>Click on &quot;What's here?&quot; in the menu that pops up.</li>
<li>Click on coordinates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost done - the map is on the page, it's zoomable, it has a marker. What left is an event handler. It doesn't work with error - <tt class="docutils literal">Cannot read property 'click' of undefined</tt>. Looks like google api handler conflicts with JQuery.</p>
