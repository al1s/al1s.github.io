<p>Day 14 - build a menu list. User story:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a user I want to add dishes to my plate, one at a time, so that I'll finally have a list of dishes.</li>
<li>As a user I want to keep this list after page reload, so that it persist window closing and I'll have the same list even after a browser restart.</li>
<li>As a user I want to mark items in a list and these marks have to persist page reload, so that I'll know what I marked specially before.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plan:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>use local storage to persist page reload;</li>
<li>keep all entered values in one list and save it to one item in a browser local storage;</li>
<li>prevent page reload on form submission;</li>
<li>consider performance as a first class user requirement;</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all - my Chrome configuration didn't let me save anything in a local storage. There are one radio and one checkboxe in Advanced config in the Cookies control list which should be considered: <cite>Allow Local data</cite> to be set and <cite>Block third-party cookies and site data</cite> unchecked.</p>
<p>What was interesting:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I've added the handler to checkbox <code>change</code> event during dynamical list item composing - it let do this if you use native interface to add elements to DOM - <code>createElement</code> and <code>appendChild</code>;</li>
<li>I've implemented <code>remove</code> button for each element added to a list just to make it more valuable. Actually it's a little TODO app, so it should have all expected functions - add/delete items to a list, check items in a list, keep items persistent.</li>
<li>I've implemented redrawing for only added item - after a user add item the only thing changes on a page - this item added to a list (Wes told about it in a tutorial video, but his code redraw the whole list). It's performance friendly way to work with a DOM.</li>
</ul>
