<li><p class="first">Built it with a stand-alone <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;div&gt;</tt> and a separate menu list. Menu is a flexbox with elements evenly spaced along the string (at least I expect it to run this way). The logo is background image positioned absolutely with calculated position to be fluid.</p>
<p>Everything is ok till my menu items is a one word long - the logo is centered and items are evenly spaced. It's not my case. I want items to be longer - two, three words long, but then all evenness goes away - the logo is still centered, menu items start to float uncontollably.</p>
<p>A  simple solution is to add explicit width value, that will ensure even spaced items. Here is example - <a class="reference external" href="http://jsfiddle.net/alstof/9fbvL900/6/">http://jsfiddle.net/alstof/9fbvL900/6/</a></p>
