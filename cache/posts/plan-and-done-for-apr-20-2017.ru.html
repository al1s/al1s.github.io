What is the problem? I have a sprite where all my icons are kept. There are both normal and retina icons. I manage how they are presented to user by &#64;media-queries. They look great on normal pixel density, but for retina they become doubled in size. The reason - how my gulp pipe build css for them - it provides width and height for retina with doubled values exactly as they look in a sprite. But I don't want them bigger, I want them to be double density.</p>
<p>But hard way - using additional wrapper and changing original positioning of an image inside a sprite. Hard coded shifts, hard coded background-size scaling. The better way is to use svg-images instead of bitmap image. More on the topic:
