No - because as a background img, it isn't part of the DOM and you can't manipulate it (from here - <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13367916">http://stackoverflow.com/a/13367916</a>).</p>
<p>There is a bunch of solutions, starting from svg embedded into stylesheet (<a class="reference external" href="https://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color/">https://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color/</a>), encode it in the url in base64 way (<a class="reference external" href="https://css-tricks.com/probably-dont-base64-svg/">https://css-tricks.com/probably-dont-base64-svg/</a>). Here is demo for different alternatives - <a class="reference external" href="http://codepen.io/noahblon/post/coloring-svgs-in-css-background-images">http://codepen.io/noahblon/post/coloring-svgs-in-css-background-images</a>. It looks like I should change svg manually, create different color versions of it, glue it into a sprite and then use it as bg-image. Gulp provides me with svg, bunched into a sprite, but with ability to work with original pictures like they are embedded (). Ok, but now - how to scale them to the right size easily?</p>
<p>Found less mixin for replacing colors and work with svg as bg-image here - <a class="reference external" href="https://zslabs.com/articles/svg-background-fill/">https://zslabs.com/articles/svg-background-fill/</a>, converted it into scss (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/less2sass/1.2.0">http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/less2sass/1.2.0</a>) and here is explanation about conversion - <a class="reference external" href="http://mstrutt.co.uk/blog/2013/08/converting-from-less-to-sass/">http://mstrutt.co.uk/blog/2013/08/converting-from-less-to-sass/</a>. And here I've found replace function for SASS - <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sassmeister.com/gist/1b4f2da5527830088e4d">https://www.sassmeister.com/gist/1b4f2da5527830088e4d</a>.</p>
<p>Haven't made it work. Tried with a codepen playground - doesn't work at all - funny.</p>
