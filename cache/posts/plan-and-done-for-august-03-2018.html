<p>Today I learned:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I liked to try TDD. Didn't have a lot of practice with it but it looks like a right way to write code. It requires a lot of work before you start coding a solution. It could work with personal projects, but it's the path to disaster in a production environment with a huge codebase and many other developers on board.</li>
<li>One more surprising observation about time planning: I thought it would take 30 minutes to code 6 little functions. In fact, 2 hours. I took into account only the time I needed to write the code, but repo work plus restrictions on available JS assets added a huge overhead.</li>
</ul>
