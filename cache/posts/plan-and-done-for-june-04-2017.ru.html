Looked through the code of spline drawing example - <a class="reference external" href="http://scaledinnovation.com/analytics/splines/aboutSplines.html">http://scaledinnovation.com/analytics/splines/aboutSplines.html</a>, it's not complicated but I want to build something even simpler utilizing cubic bezier curve - only one control point for each pair of mouse movement captured points. I have to find the coordinates of that control point and my idea is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>to take three points with every event;</li>
<li>to calculate distance between these three points;</li>
<li>to build auxiliary similar triangle on the base of the segment connecting first two points;</li>
<li>to calculate an angle between first and third segments - it's the same angle as in my auxiliary triangle;</li>
<li>to find coordinates of the control point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tried different options for calculating control point coordinates (this for example - <a class="reference external" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1989113">https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1989113</a>). All I've got is a wavy line with skips. Then I just decided to take every three points and to use middle point as a control point. It works but in a weird way - I've got two twisted lines.</p>
<p>Finally I've checked what Wes Bos has in the tutorial on Day 8. It's easy! Much easier than I did - just straight lines from one point to another. I overcomplicate things - when I see a task, my approach is sometimes too twisted, too overthinked. Why am I so appealed by complex answers? Have to train, to learn myself to be open to simple solutions first. For example, the task is to implement smooth width increasing/decreasing while drawing in HTML5 canvas depending on the mouse speed. My approach leads to visual steps in line width change. But what I really need is to increament value by one step at a time in a given interval. After the tutorial all is clear and the only thing left is to rebuild from scratch.</p>
