<p>I've read W3 spec on box model and behaviour of collapsing margins and tried to model different conditions when they collapse. But finally found this [article](<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/collapsing-margins/">https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/collapsing-margins/</a>) where everything already illustrated well.</p>
