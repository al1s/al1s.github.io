<p>There are two essay topics in an application form:</p>

<h2>Why are you interested in programming? (specify whether you're interested in Dev or PM track)</h2>
<p>I'm interested in the Dev track.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago I self-studied Intel assembly language. I wrote simple utilities: a tiny module that did not let the computer slip into a screensaver. And there were many patches to game executables to get immortality or unlimited ammo. It was MS-DOS epoch.</p>
<p>At University I worked in my faculty computer lab as a system administrator and database developer. I took a part in the implementation of the app for monitoring student academic performance. That was the time of Windows 95 and MS Access.</p>
<p>Last 10 years I worked with large scale databases. We processed 2 million financial transactions per day. And there were almost 500 million in an online data warehouse. It was the time of great challenges and accomplishments.  I achieved recognition as an application developer, a team-lead, and a solution architect. There I've got experience with MS SQL Server and its analytical, reporting and integration services.</p>
<p>About a year ago I moved from Russia to the USA I set the new goals. And one of it is to deliver value as a professional web developer. I'm stubborn in pursuing my goals so I dedicate all my spare time during the last six months to a self-studying. My accomplishments are in the next section.</p>
<p>Einstein once said, that if the Universe is a friendly place then we would use our technology to create tools and models for understanding this Universe. That's what motivates me - the pure curiosity about the world, about people, and tools. Ultimately all the tools we end up creating are just a way for self-exploring and self-awareness.</p>
<p>My recent progress and perseverance will bring their fruits. Microsoft LEAP program could become a huge leverage towards the chosen goal for me.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-have-you-done-to-expose-yourself-to-programming-so-far-specify-whether-you-re-interested-in-dev-or-pm-track">
<h2>What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far? (specify whether you're interested in Dev or PM track)</h2>
<p>The first web development experience I've got in 2000. I've built a personal page to satisfy the curiosity about the technologies available and share my notes with friends and family. Then there was nothing of modern stuff like ES5, HTML5, CSS3 available.</p>
<p>Done in the last six months: brushed up HTML skills, studied CSS, practiced Javascript.</p>
<p>I've started my current journey into web development with building replicas. My models were interesting demos of different kinds of page layout. The first was <a class="reference external" href="https://al1s.github.io/Futurismo/">https://al1s.github.io/Futurismo/</a> where I've practiced CSS flexbox and horizontal spacing in web typography. The next was <a class="reference external" href="https://al1s.github.io/Jazz/">https://al1s.github.io/Jazz/</a> where I practiced CSS Flexbox. The model layout was built using CSS Grid, so I was curious how it to achieve the same appearance with older tools.</p>
<p>I spent almost half of a month moving through 30 days javascript challenge (one day, one app). It was challenging and I wrote multiple blog posts about my progress, challenges, and the ways to overcome them. Working demos are collected here - <a class="reference external" href="https://al1s.github.io/JavaScript30/">https://al1s.github.io/JavaScript30/</a>. I haven't finished it yet for the reason to concentrate more on solving algorithms' tasks and to lean on a crisper curriculum.</p>
<p>The next step was a fictitious landing page. The goal was to implement it from design layout keeping all sizes perfectly matched to the original. I've practiced BEM CSS methodology, responsive, mobile-first approach. The page was built using Gulp automation and SASS CSS processor.</p>
<p>Along with projects I've already mentioned I'm following Free Code Camp curriculum. I've built WeatherNow app - a local weather informer (<a class="reference external" href="https://al1s.github.io/WeatherNow/">https://al1s.github.io/WeatherNow/</a>). My notes made during the implementation I compiled in an article. I published it (<a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/4DDKes">https://goo.gl/4DDKes</a>) to share my thoughts about the design process and chosen building tools. Another app is an AskWiki (<a class="reference external" href="https://al1s.github.io/AskWiki/">https://al1s.github.io/AskWiki/</a>). It's a facade to the Wikipedia search engine. Here I practiced working with VS Code as IDE (because Atom glitches finally started to irk and Vim or browser's dev tools are too spartan as JS IDE).</p>
