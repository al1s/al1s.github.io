<p>Today I learned:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I enjoyed our Pair programming session. I did it before on my previous job, so it was interesting to dive into it again but with only English available as a mean of communication.</li>
<li>To be a driver takes a lot of energy not to switch roles with a navigator and vice versa. It's always easier to grab the key and start typing, then to stop and think.</li>
<li>The hardest part is to explain my thoughts in a simple and digestible form. The easiest part is to be a driver - push buttons, check for correct syntax.</li>
<li>As a navigator, I planned and utilized all two hours to improve my code in the way I like.</li>
<li>As a driver, it took 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
