<li><p class="first">Stuck a little with the yesterday's problem. The reason - can't add up only those remainder's groups which don't give a divider mutually - I've set an array of 'banned' remainders and try to use it inside <code>Array.prototype.reduce()</code> but it seems like it's not seen inside <code>reduce</code> loop.</p>
<p>The solution for this was quite easy - I added to an array numbers and checked if an element is included with a string equivalent. Added plus sign before an element so it looked like <code>Arr.includes(+num)</code> and everything started to work great.</p>
